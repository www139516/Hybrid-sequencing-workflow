# Hybrid-sequencing-workflow
This code is for processing the hybrid sequencing data from maize, utilizing the RNA-seq data to correct and check the whole chain of splicing junction of reads identified in PacBio-sequencing. 

This work is derived from STAIR pipeline. We have edited and optimized it to ensure that the scripts fit for processing long-read sequencing data from maize.

The scripts depend on the following software/packages:
1. pandas
2. IsoSeq3
3. click
4. python 3
