# Hybrid-sequencing-workflow
These scripts are used for processing the hybrid sequencing data from maize, utilizing the RNA-seq data to correct and checking the whole chain of splicing junction of reads identified in PacBio-sequencing.

The workflow are based on the STAIR pipeline. We have edited and optimized it to ensure it fits for the IsoSeq3 and sequencing data from maize.

The workflow is depended on the following softwares/packages:
1. IsoSeq3
2. python 3.0 or higher
3. pandas
4. click
